# StoryTellingWithData
<a href="https://www.storytellingwithdata.com">StoryTelling With Data</a> is a website that wants to help people and organizations create graphs that make sense and weave them into compelling, action-inspiring stories.

You can find <a href="https://community.storytellingwithdata.com/challenges">challenges</a> every month.

On August 2022 I decided to start to enroll in these challenges. In this repository you could find some of my works done.

I hope you enjoy them. Any comments and suggestions would be welcome. I also hope to improve my skills in visualization area.
